## Game summary

[Threes](http://asherv.com/threes/) is designed by Asher Vollmer. The game is available to download on iOS [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/threes/id779157948?mt=8).


Threes is a numbers game in a 4 by 4 grid. You can merge the grid up, down, left and right.  The tiles merge and sum up if :

1) The tiles are 1 & 2

2) The tiles are the same numbers

else, the tiles stay where they are.

Moving tiles in one direction will add one new tile to the bottom row or right column depending on which way the user moves the tiles. New tiles can be 1, 2, 3, or a wild card that is the highest value on the board divided by 2.
